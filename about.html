    <p>Our reputation for quality furniture and service at fair prices began in 1938 when John B. Lindsay embarked on his furniture career. His son John Lindsay II, and grandsons, Benji and Ryan, carry on his legacy totaling more than 140 years of home decorating experience. Recognized as the home furnishings dealer where good taste is never expensive, the Lindsays bring a strong commitment of honesty and integrity to every customer relationship. Lindsay Furniture is the area's oldest and most trusted locally owned furniture store.

        In 2000, Lindsay Furniture opened a new, state of the art warehouse facility. This 7,000 square foot warehouse has allowed the Lindsays to better service their customers by stocking an even larger selection of home furnishings, bedding, accessories, and electronics.
        
        Lindsay Furniture Company cares about their customers and treats each one as if they were neighbors. When you shop at Lindsays, you're not dealing with a faceless corporation, but a family that's committed to doing business the right way.</p>
